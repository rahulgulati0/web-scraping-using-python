# Legal & Ethical Considerations

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the legal landscape of web scraping
- Know how to identify and respect website terms of service
- Implement ethical scraping practices
- Understand robots.txt and its importance
- Learn about copyright and data protection laws
- Develop responsible scraping guidelines

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Framework

### 1. Terms of Service (ToS)

**Always check and respect website Terms of Service:**

```python
def check_terms_of_service():
    """
    Manual checklist for Terms of Service review
    """
    checklist = [
        "Have I read the website's Terms of Service?",
        "Does the ToS explicitly prohibit automated access?",
        "Are there specific restrictions on data use?",
        "Do I need permission for commercial use?",
        "Are there rate limiting requirements?",
        "What data can I collect vs. what I should avoid?"
    ]
    
    for item in checklist:
        print(f"‚òê {item}")
```

**Common ToS restrictions to watch for:**
- Prohibition of automated access
- Rate limiting requirements
- Restrictions on data redistribution
- Commercial use limitations
- Personal data collection rules

### 2. Copyright Law

**Understand what you can and cannot scrape:**

- **Facts and data**: Generally not copyrightable
- **Original content**: Protected by copyright
- **Database rights**: May apply to collections of data
- **Fair use**: Limited exceptions for research/criticism

```python
def content_classification():
    """
    Guide for classifying scrapeable content
    """
    guidelines = {
        "Generally OK to scrape": [
            "Public facts and data",
            "Prices and product specifications", 
            "Business listings and contact info",
            "News headlines (not full articles)",
            "Public social media posts (with care)"
        ],
        "Requires caution": [
            "Full news articles",
            "Product descriptions",
            "User-generated content",
            "Images and media files",
            "Structured databases"
        ],
        "Generally avoid": [
            "Copyrighted images/videos",
            "Premium/paid content",
            "Personal/private information",
            "Content behind paywalls",
            "Copyrighted creative works"
        ]
    }
    
    for category, items in guidelines.items():
        print(f"\n{category}:")
        for item in items:
            print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {item}")
```

### 3. Data Protection Laws

**Major regulations to be aware of:**

- **GDPR (EU)**: Strict rules for personal data
- **CCPA (California)**: Consumer privacy rights
- **PIPEDA (Canada)**: Personal information protection
- **National data protection laws**: Vary by country

```python
def gdpr_compliance_check():
    """
    GDPR compliance considerations for web scraping
    """
    considerations = {
        "Legal basis": "Do you have a legitimate interest?",
        "Data minimization": "Are you collecting only necessary data?",
        "Purpose limitation": "Is data used only for stated purpose?", 
        "Storage limitation": "Do you delete data when no longer needed?",
        "Rights of individuals": "Can people request data deletion?",
        "Data security": "Is scraped data properly secured?"
    }
    
    print("GDPR Compliance Checklist:")
    for principle, question in considerations.items():
        print(f"‚Ä¢ {principle}: {question}")
```

## ü§ñ Technical Ethics

### 1. robots.txt Protocol

**Always check and respect robots.txt:**

```python
import urllib.robotparser
import requests
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RobotsChecker:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url.rstrip('/')
        self.robots_url = urljoin(self.base_url, '/robots.txt')
        self.rp = urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser()
        self.load_robots()
    
    def load_robots(self):
        """Load and parse robots.txt"""
        try:
            self.rp.set_url(self.robots_url)
            self.rp.read()
            print(f"‚úì Successfully loaded robots.txt from {self.robots_url}")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö† Could not load robots.txt: {e}")
            return False
    
    def can_fetch(self, url, user_agent='*'):
        """Check if URL can be fetched"""
        return self.rp.can_fetch(user_agent, url)
    
    def get_crawl_delay(self, user_agent='*'):
        """Get recommended crawl delay"""
        return self.rp.crawl_delay(user_agent)
    
    def get_request_rate(self, user_agent='*'):
        """Get request rate if specified"""
        return self.rp.request_rate(user_agent)
    
    def show_robots_summary(self):
        """Display robots.txt summary"""
        try:
            response = requests.get(self.robots_url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(f"\nRobots.txt content for {self.base_url}:")
                print("-" * 50)
                print(response.text)
                print("-" * 50)
            else:
                print(f"No robots.txt found (HTTP {response.status_code})")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching robots.txt: {e}")

# Usage example
checker = RobotsChecker('https://example.com')
checker.show_robots_summary()

if checker.can_fetch('https://example.com/products'):
    delay = checker.get_crawl_delay()
    print(f"‚úì Can scrape with delay: {delay} seconds")
else:
    print("‚úó Scraping not allowed by robots.txt")
```

### 2. Rate Limiting & Server Respect

**Implement respectful request patterns:**

```python
import time
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class RespectfulScraper:
    def __init__(self, delay=1.0, max_requests_per_minute=30):
        self.delay = delay
        self.max_requests_per_minute = max_requests_per_minute
        self.request_times = []
        self.session = requests.Session()
        
        # Set a reasonable User-Agent
        self.session.headers.update({
            'User-Agent': 'Research Bot 1.0 (Educational Purpose)'
        })
    
    def _wait_if_needed(self):
        """Implement rate limiting"""
        now = datetime.now()
        
        # Remove requests older than 1 minute
        self.request_times = [
            req_time for req_time in self.request_times 
            if now - req_time < timedelta(minutes=1)
        ]
        
        # Check if we need to wait
        if len(self.request_times) >= self.max_requests_per_minute:
            wait_time = 60 - (now - self.request_times[0]).total_seconds()
            if wait_time > 0:
                print(f"Rate limit reached. Waiting {wait_time:.1f} seconds...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
        
        # Add mandatory delay between requests
        if self.request_times:
            last_request = self.request_times[-1]
            time_since_last = (now - last_request).total_seconds()
            if time_since_last < self.delay:
                time.sleep(self.delay - time_since_last)
    
    def get(self, url):
        """Make a respectful GET request"""
        self._wait_if_needed()
        
        try:
            response = self.session.get(url, timeout=10)
            self.request_times.append(datetime.now())
            
            # Be extra careful with server errors
            if response.status_code >= 500:
                print(f"Server error {response.status_code}. Backing off...")
                time.sleep(self.delay * 5)  # Extra delay for server issues
            
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Request failed: {e}")
            return None

# Usage
scraper = RespectfulScraper(delay=2.0, max_requests_per_minute=20)
response = scraper.get('https://example.com')
```

### 3. Data Usage Guidelines

**Ethical data handling practices:**

```python
class EthicalDataHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.personal_data_patterns = [
            r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b',  # SSN pattern
            r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b',  # Email
            r'\b\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}\b',  # Phone numbers
        ]
    
    def sanitize_content(self, content):
        """Remove potential personal information"""
        import re
        
        sanitized = content
        for pattern in self.personal_data_patterns:
            sanitized = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED]', sanitized, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
        
        return sanitized
    
    def data_usage_guidelines(self):
        """Display ethical data usage guidelines"""
        guidelines = {
            "Collection": [
                "Only collect data you actually need",
                "Avoid personal/sensitive information when possible",

                "Consider impact on data subjects"
            ],
            "Sharing": [
                "Anonymize data before sharing",
                "Check legal requirements for data transfer",
                "Obtain necessary permissions",
                "Document data sharing agreements"
            ]
        }
        
        for category, rules in guidelines.items():
            print(f"\n{category}:")
            for rule in rules:
                print(f"  ‚úì {rule}")
